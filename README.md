# Supplementary code for "Network Thermodynamical Modelling of Bioelectrical Systems: A Bond Graph Approach"

This repository contains code for the examples in Gawthrop and Pan (2020), available at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02217) and published at [doi](https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/bioe.2020.0042). Each of the following links displays the notebook using nbviewer. The notebook may be run using the binder link (three circles) in the nbviewer menu.

There are two notebooks:
1. [Electrochemical reactions](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gawthrop/GawPan20/blob/main/ElectroChemical.ipynb)
2. [Redox reactions](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gawthrop/GawPan20/blob/main/Redox.ipynb)
